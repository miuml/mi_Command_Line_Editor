mi_Command_Line_Editor
======================

See the wiki on github for detailed instructions.

A very basic command line editor that uses the miUML posgresql API functions to build, view and edit miUML models.

Start it up by launching miuml.py.

You should get some intro text and a * prompt.

From there, just type help.

You will need the miUML metmaodel (API) postgresql database up and running
so that the command line editor can connect to it.
